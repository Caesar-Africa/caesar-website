# Caesar

> Caesar is a crypto tax engine for platforms and regulators in Africa. We turn transaction data from exchanges, wallets, and fintechs into tax-ready outputs: user-level tax positions, platform-level VAT and WHT, and compliance reports—all aligned with Nigerian tax rules.

Caesar is built for organisations, not individual taxpayers. We integrate via API or file upload to calculate crypto tax obligations automatically.

**Key facts:**
- Based in Lagos, Nigeria
- Supports Nigerian tax rules (individual PIT, corporate CIT, VAT, WHT)
- Serves crypto exchanges, wallets, fintechs, and tax authorities
- Pricing: annual contracts starting at $5,000/year for platforms
- Contact: hello@caesar.africa

**What we calculate:**
- User tax positions: capital gains and income from crypto trading, staking, rewards, airdrops, NFTs
- Platform obligations: VAT on fees, WHT on service payments, crypto-related profits
- Tax outputs updated when Nigerian rules change
